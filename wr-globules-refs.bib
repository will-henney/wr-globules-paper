  abstract =	 {We use WR124 (WN8h) and its associated nebula M1-67,
                  to test theoretical non-LTE models for Wolf-Rayet
                  (WR) stars. Lyman continuum ionizing flux
                  distributions derived from a stellar analysis of
                  WR124, are compared with nebular properties via
                  photo-ionization modelling. Our study demonstrates
                  the significant role that line blanketing plays in
                  affecting the Lyman ionizing energy distribution of
                  WR stars, of particular relevance to the study of H
                  ii regions containing young stellar populations. We
                  confirm previous results that non-line blanketed WR
                  energy distributions fail to explain the observed
                  nebular properties of M1-67, such that the predicted
                  ionizing spectrum is too hard. A line blanketed
                  analysis of WR124 is carried out using the method of
                  Hillier &amp; Miller (1998), with stellar properties
                  in accord with previous results, except that the
                  inclusion of clumping in the stellar wind reduces
                  its wind performance factor to only ~ 2. The
                  ionizing spectrum of the line blanketed model is
                  much softer than for a comparable temperature
                  unblanketed case, such that negligible flux is
                  emitted with energy above the He i lambda 504
                  edge. Photo-ionization modelling, incorporating the
                  observed radial density distribution for M1-67
                  reveals excellent agreement with the observed
                  nebular electron temperature, ionization balance and
                  line strengths. An alternative stellar model of
                  WR124 is calculated, following the technique of de
                  Koter et al. (1997), augmented to include line
                  blanketing following Schmutz et al. (1991). Good
                  consistency is reached regarding the stellar
                  properties of WR124, but agreement with the nebular
                  properties of M1-67 is somewhat poorer than for the
                  Hillier &amp; Miller code.},

  abstract =	 {Aims: This work aims to disentangle the
                  morphological, kinematic, and chemical components of
                  the nebula M1-67 to shed light on its process of
                  formation around the central Wolf-Rayet (WR) star
                  WR124.  Methods: We have carried out integral field
                  spectroscopy observations over two regions of M1-67,
                  covering most of the nebula in the optical
                  range. Maps of electron density, line ratios, and
                  radial velocity were created to perform a detailed
                  analysis of the two-dimensional structure. We
                  studied the physical and chemical properties by
                  means of integrated spectra selected over the whole
                  nebula. Photoionization models were performed to
                  confirm the empirical chemical results
                  theoretically. In addition, we obtained and analysed
                  infrared spectroscopic data and the MIPS 24 mum
                  image of M1-67 from Spitzer.  Results: We find that
                  the ionized gas of M1-67 is condensed in knots
                  aligned in a preferred axis along the NE-SW
                  direction, like a bipolar structure. Both electron
                  density and radial velocity decrease in this
                  direction when moving away from the central
                  star. From the derived electron temperature, Te ~
                  8200 K, we have estimated chemical abundances,
                  obtaining that nitrogen appears strongly enriched
                  and oxygen depleted. From the last two results, we
                  infer that this bipolarity is the consequence of an
                  ejection of an evolved stage of WR124 with material
                  processed in the CNO cycle. Furthermore, we find two
                  regions placed outside of the bipolar structure with
                  different spectral and chemical properties. The
                  infrared study has revealed that the bipolar axis is
                  composed of ionized gas with a low ionization degree
                  that is well mixed with warm dust and of a spherical
                  bubble surrounding the ejection at 24 mum. Taking
                  the evolution of a 60 M&sun; star and the temporal
                  scale of the bipolar ejection into account, we
                  propose that the observed gas was ejected during an
                  eruption in the luminous blue variable stage. The
                  star has entered the WR phase recently without
                  apparent signs of interaction between WR-winds and
                  interstellar material.  Based on observations

                  in radius, expanding with a velocity of 46 km s(-1)

  abstract =	 {Among the different types of massive stars in
                  advanced evolutionary stages is the enigmatic WN8h
                  type. There are only a few Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars
                  with this spectral type in our Galaxy. It has long
                  been suggested that WN8h-type stars are the products
                  of binary evolution that may harbor neutron stars
                  (NS). One of the most intriguing WN8h stars is the
                  runaway WR 124 surrounded by its magnificent nebula
                  M1-67. We test the presence of an accreting NS
                  companion in WR 124 using ∼100 ks long observations
                  by the Chandra X-ray observatory. The hard X-ray
                  emission from WR 124 with a luminosity of L
                  <SUB>X</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>31</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> is
                  marginally detected. We use the non-local
                  thermodynamic equilibrium stellar atmosphere code
                  PoWR to estimate the WR wind opacity to the
                  X-rays. The wind of a WN8-type star is effectively
                  opaque for X-rays, hence the low X-ray luminosity of
                  WR 124 does not rule out the presence of an embedded
                  compact object. We suggest that, in general,
                  high-opacity WR winds could prevent X-ray detections
                  of embedded NS, and be an explanation for the

                  are potentially useful to derive time-dependent
                  mass-loss rates and hence constrain the evolution of
                  the central stars. A key case in this context is the
                  relatively young ejection-type nebula M1-67 around
                  the runaway Population I Wolf-Rayet star WR 124
                  (=209 BAC), which exhibits a WN 8 spectrum. With
                  HST-WFPC2 we have obtained a deep, Hα image of
                  M1-67. This image shows a wealth of complex detail
                  that was briefly presented previously by Grosdidier
                  et al. With the interferometer of the Université
                  Laval (Québec, Canada), we have obtained
                  complementary Fabry-Perot Hα data using
                  Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MOS/SIS. From
                  these data M1-67 appears more or less as a spherical
                  (or elliptical, with the major axis along the line
                  of sight), thick, shell seen almost exactly along
                  its direction of rapid spatial motion away from the
                  observer in the ISM. However, a simple thick shell
                  by itself would not explain the observed multiple
                  radial velocities along the line of sight. This
                  velocity dispersion leads one to consider M1-67 as a
                  thick accelerating shell. Given the extreme
                  perturbations of the velocity field in M1-67, it is
                  virtually impossible to measure any systematic
                  impact of the present WR (or previous LBV) wind on
                  the nebular structure. The irregular nature of the
                  velocity field is likely due to either large
                  variations in the density distribution of the
                  ambient ISM or large variations in the central star
                  mass-loss history. In addition, either from the
                  density field or the velocity field, we find no
                  clear evidence for a bipolar outflow, as was claimed
                  in other studies. On the deep Hα image we have
                  performed continuous wavelet transforms to isolate
                  stochastic structures of different characteristic
                  size and look for scaling laws. Small-scale wavelet
                  coefficients show that the density field of M1-67 is
                  remarkably structured in chaotically (or possibly
                  radially) oriented filaments everywhere in the
                  nebula. We draw attention to a short, marginally
                  inertial range at the smallest scales
                  (6.7-15.0×10<SUP>-3</SUP> pc), which can be
                  attributed to turbulence in the nebula, and a strong
                  scale break at larger scales. Examination of the
                  structure functions for different orders shows that
                  the turbulent regime may be intermittent. Using our
                  Fabry-Perot interferograms, we also present an
                  investigation of the statistical properties of
                  fluctuating gas motions using structure functions
                  traced by Hα emission-line centroid velocities. We
                  find that there is a clear correlation at scales
                  0.02-0.22 pc between the mean quadratic differences
                  of radial velocities and distance over the surface
                  of the nebula. This implies that the velocity field
                  shows an inertial range likely related to
                  turbulence, though not coincident with the small
                  inertial range detected from the density field. The
                  first- and second-order moments of the velocity
                  increments are found to scale as
                  &lt;|Δv(r)|&gt;~r<SUP>0.5</SUP> and
                  &lt;|Δv(r)|<SUP>2</SUP>&gt;~r<SUP>0.9</SUP>. The
                  former scaling law strongly suggests that
                  supersonic, compressible turbulence is at play in
                  the nebula; on the other hand, the latter scaling
                  law agrees very well with Larson-type laws for
                  velocity turbulence. Examination of the structure
                  functions for different orders shows that the
                  turbulent regime is slightly intermittent and highly
                  multifractal with universal multifractal indexes
                  α~1.90-1.92 and C<SUB>1</SUB>~0.04+/-0.01. Based on

                  associated with the late stages of massive star
                  evolution. Archive photometric observations from
                  Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer(WISE), Spitzer
                  (MIPS), and Herschel (PACS and SPIRE) are used to
                  construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of
                  the nebula in the wavelength range of 12-500 μm. The
                  infrared (photometric and spectroscopic) data and
                  nebular optical data from the literature are
                  modelled simultaneously using the spectral synthesis
                  code CLOUDY, where the free parameters are the gas
                  density distribution and the dust grain-sized
                  distribution. The infrared SED can be reproduced by
                  dust grains with two size distributions: an MRN
                  power-law distribution with grain sizes between
                  0.005 and 0.05 μm and a population of large grains
                  with representative size of 0.9 μm. The latter
                  points towards an eruptive origin for the formation
                  of M 1-67. The model predicts a nebular ionized gas

                  observations of the interstellar medium (ISM)
                  surrounding the runaway star WR 124 and the nebula M
                  1-67. The H I data have been used to investigate the
                  effects that a star with a strong stellar wind and a
                  high peculiar velocity has on the ISM. <BR
                  />Methods: The VLA 21 cm H I observations were
                  combined with single-dish Effelsberg observations to
                  produce a series of H I images sensitive to all
                  angular scales from the VLA resolution limit (∼
                  46'') up to the primary field of individual VLA
                  antennae (FWHM = 36'). MSX and IRIS images were used
                  to analyze the infrared emission around the
                  star. Because the star is highly supersonic with
                  respect to its local ISM, the observed H I
                  distribution around the star is interpreted in terms
                  of a simple bow shock model. <BR />Results: The
                  analysis of the H I data reveals the presence of a
                  cavity centered on the star at an LSR velocity of ∼
                  60 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, consistent with a distance
                  estimate of 5 kpc for WR 124. A second H I cavity is
                  observed located 10' to the north of the stellar
                  position, consistent with the direction of motion of
                  WR 124. The VLA continuum image at 8.5 GHz shows a
                  remarkable resemblance to the optical images. All
                  available radio continuum data suggest a purely
                  thermal spectrum for the nebula. The MSX and IRIS
                  infrared data show a changing morphology with
                  wavelength. The dust temperature deduced from the
                  infrared luminosities is in agreement with previous

  abstract =	 {We present a 3D mapping of the Wolf-Rayet (WR)
                  nebula M 1-67 around WR 124. We obtained
                  high-resolution San Pedro Mártir (SPM) Manchester
                  Echelle Spectrograph (MES) observations along 17
                  long-slit positions covering all morphological
                  features in M 1-67. We are able to unveil the true
                  morphology of M 1-67 and its kinematics by
                  interpreting the SPM MES observations by means of
                  the 3D modelling tool for Astrophysics SHAPE. Our
                  SHAPE model that best reproduces the SPM MES data
                  includes three concentric bipolar structures
                  composed by a hollow ellipsoidal structure and a
                  torus. In addition, the model requires the presence
                  of expanding jets and broken blisters in order to
                  reproduce specific spectral features. Our results
                  are consistent with the idea that M 1-67 and its
                  progenitor star WR 124 have formed through a common
                  envelope scenario that occurred 11.8$^ +4.6 _ -0.8 $

                  previous suggestions of the presence of a bow shock
                  structure surrounding M 1-67. We interpret that the
                  bright structures detected in the spectra extracted
                  from the central regions are produced by wind
                  compression at the receding region of the innermost
                  structure in M 1-67. Furthermore, WR 124 is moving
                  through a low-density region above the Galactic
                  plane that has negligibly affected the formation

                  Wolf-Rayet (WR) star WR 124 is presented. We
                  simulated the outbursts of nebulae with different
                  morphologies, to compare the results to the observed
                  dynamical spectra of M1-67. We found that it has
                  been interacting with the surrounding ISM and has
                  formed a bow shock due to its high velocity of about
                  180 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> relative to the local ISM. The
                  star is about 1.3 parsec away from the front of this
                  bow shock. The outbursts that are responsible for
                  the nebula are assumed to be discrete outbursts that
                  occurred inside this bow shock. The ejecta collide
                  with this bow shock shortly after the
                  outburst. After the collision, they are dragged away
                  by the pressure of the ISM, along the surface of the
                  bow shock. The bow shock is oriented in such way
                  that we are looking from the rear into this
                  paraboloid, almost along the main axis. Evidence for
                  this is given firstly by the fact that the far
                  hemisphere is much brighter than the near
                  hemisphere, secondly by the fact that there is
                  hardly any emission found with radial velocities
                  higher than the star's radial velocity, thirdly by
                  the fact that the star looks to be in the centre of
                  the nebula, as seen from Earth, and finally by the
                  asymmetric overall velocity distribution of the
                  nebula, which indicates higher radial velocities in
                  the centre of the nebula, and lower velocities near
                  the edges. We find evidence for at least two
                  discrete outbursts that occurred inside this bow
                  shock. For these outbursts, we find expansion
                  velocities of v<SUB>exp</SUB> ~ 150 km
                  s<SUP>-1</SUP> and dynamical timescales of about 0.8
                  and 2 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr, which are typical values
                  for LBV outbursts. We therefore conclude that M1-67
                  originates from several outbursts that occurred
                  inside the bow shock around WR 124, during an LBV
                  phase that preceded the current WR phase of the
                  star.},

  abstract =	 {We present a detailed study of M1-67, a well-known
                  nebula around the population I Wolf-Rayet star WR
                  124 (WNh 8), based on datacubes obtained with the
                  imaging Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE at
                  the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). This
                  allowed us to reconstruct detailed emission-line
                  ratio maps that highlight clear orthogonal features
                  from a chemical abundance point of view, a complete
                  extinction map, as well as the electron density and
                  temperature structures. In addition to this
                  information, velocity maps were obtained shedding
                  light on the bow shock structure due to the high
                  velocity of WR124, qualified as a runaway star,
                  which is about +190\,km\,s$^ -1 $ relative to the
                  local ISM. Interaction between the latter structure
                  and spherical and non-spherical outburst could
                  explain the global morphology of M1-67.},
